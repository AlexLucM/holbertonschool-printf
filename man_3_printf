.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2025" "1.0" "_printf Manual"

.SH NAME
_printf \- print formatted output to standard output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.BI "int _printf(const char *format, ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function is a custom implementation of the standard C
.B printf()
function. It writes characters to the standard output stream under the
control of a
.I format
string. This string specifies how each argument should be converted and
displayed.

.PP
The
.I format
string is a sequence of ordinary characters and conversion specifications.
Ordinary characters are written as they appear. A percent sign
.RB ( % )
introduces a conversion specification that tells
.B _printf()
to fetch the next argument and format it according to the specifier that
follows.

.PP
In this project implementation, the following conversion specifiers are
supported:

.TP
.B %c
The corresponding argument is taken as an
.B int
and printed as a single character.

.TP
.B %s
The argument is expected to be a pointer to a NUL-terminated string
.RB ( char\ * ).
Characters are printed until the terminating '\\0' is reached. If the
pointer is
.B NULL
the string "(null)" is printed instead.

.TP
.B %d
.TP
.B %i
The argument is read as an
.B int
and written in signed decimal notation. A leading minus sign is printed
for negative values. Edge cases such as the minimum integer value
are handled correctly.

.TP
.B %%
Prints a single '%' character. No argument is consumed.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the total number of characters written to standard output.
The terminating '\\0' used for strings is not counted.

.PP
If
.I format
is
.B NULL
or if an internal error occurs while writing output,
.B _printf()
returns
.BR -1 .

.SH EXAMPLES
Some simple uses of
.B _printf()
are shown below:

.nf
_printf("Hello, C27 cohort!\\n");
    /* Output: Hello, C27 cohort!    */
    /* Return value: 21             */

_printf("Char: %c, percent: %%\\n", 'X');
    /* Output: Char: X, percent: %   */

_printf("Zero as number: %d\\n", 0);
    /* Output: Zero as number: 0     */

_printf("Negative value: %i\\n", -272025);
    /* Output: Negative value: -272025 */
.fi

.SH NOTES
This student version of
.B _printf()
focuses on the basic specifiers
.BR %c ,
.BR %s ,
.BR %d ,
.BR %i
and
.BR %% .
It does not yet implement width, precision, flags, or length modifiers.
Specifiers such as
.BR %u ,
.BR %o ,
.BR %x ,
.BR %X
and
.BR %p
are not handled in the mandatory part of the project.

If an unknown specifier is encountered (for example "%k"), this
implementation prints the '%' character followed by the unknown letter,
which may differ from the behaviour of the standard
.B printf
function.

Internally,
.B _printf()
uses the variadic macros
.BR va_start (3),
.BR va_arg (3)
and
.BR va_end (3)
and writes characters using the
.B write(2)
system call.

.BR va_arg (3),
.BR va_end (3)

.SH BUGS
This simplified implementation does not perform advanced error handling
or buffering. Very long output or unusual environments may expose
limitations compared to the standard C library
.B printf().

.SH HISTORY
This project was completed in 2025 as part of the Holberton School
curriculum to practise C programming, variadic functions and formatted
output.
