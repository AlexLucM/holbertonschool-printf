.SH NAME
.B _printf
\- format and print data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _printf
.I FORMAT
.RI [ ARGUMENT ] "..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
prints the ARGUMENTs according to the FORMAT string.

The FORMAT string is composed of ordinary characters and conversion
specifiers. Ordinary characters are written to the standard output
unchanged. A conversion specifier begins with the character '%'
and is followed by a conversion letter that controls how the next
argument is formatted.

Some useful escape sequences in the FORMAT string include:
.IP \" 4
\\\"   double quote
.IP
\\\\   backslash
.IP
\\n   new line
.IP
\\t   horizontal tab
.IP
%%   a single '%' character

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following conversion specifiers and their meanings are supported
or may be implemented as part of the project:

.IP %c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character
is written.

.IP %s
The
.I char *
argument is expected to be a pointer to a NUL-terminated string. The
characters of the string are written up to but not including the
terminating '\\0'.

.IP %d, %i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation and written.

.IP %b
The unsigned int argument is converted to binary representation.

.IP %o, %u, %x, %X
The unsigned int argument is converted to:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
unsigned octal (\fBo\fP)
.IP \(bu
unsigned decimal (\fBu\fP)
.IP \(bu
unsigned hexadecimal using lowercase letters (\fBx\fP)
.IP \(bu
unsigned hexadecimal using uppercase letters (\fBX\fP)
.RE

.IP %S
Characters from the string argument are written up to the terminating
'\\0'. Non-printable characters (ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are
represented as '\\x' followed by the hexadecimal code value in
two uppercase digits.

.IP %p
The
.I void *
pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal notation.

(Depending on the tasks completed, not all of the above may be
implemented; they are listed here for documentation of the full
project.)
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
_printf("This is a string\\n");
.br
_printf("%s\\n", "I am a string too!");
.IP
_printf("Character: [%c]\\n", 'H');
.IP
_printf("Numbers: [%d] and [%i]\\n", 2, 5);
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters printed (excluding the terminating
null byte used to end C strings).

If an error occurs, or if FORMAT is NULL, the function returns -1.
