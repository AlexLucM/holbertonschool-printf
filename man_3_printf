.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf() produces output according to a format string and a variable number
of arguments. It writes output to the standard output stream.

The format string is composed of ordinary characters and conversion
specifiers. Ordinary characters are copied unchanged to the output.

A conversion specifier starts with the character % and is followed by one of
the following characters:
.TP
.B %c
Print a single character.
.TP
.B %s
Print a NULL-terminated C string.
.TP
.B %%
Print a literal % character.
.TP
.B %d
Print a signed decimal integer.
.TP
.B %i
Print a signed decimal integer.

If the format string is NULL or ends with a single %, the function returns -1.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, _printf() returns the number of characters printed.
On failure, it returns -1.
