.SH NAME
_printf \- produce output according to a format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
is a custom implementation of the standard
.B printf (3)
function. It produces output according to a format string and a variable
number of arguments. The result is written to the standard output
(file descriptor 1) using the system call
.BR write (2).

.PP
The
.I format
string is composed of ordinary characters and conversion specifiers.
Ordinary characters are printed as they appear in the string.

.PP
A conversion specifier starts with the character
.B %
followed by a single conversion character which specifies how the
corresponding argument is converted and printed.

.PP
This implementation supports the following conversion specifiers:

.TP
.B %c
Print a single character. The corresponding argument is taken as an
.B int
and converted to
.B char
before printing.

.TP
.B %s
Print a null-terminated C string. The corresponding argument must be
of type
.B "char *" .
Characters are printed until a terminating null byte ('\0') is found.
If the pointer is
.BR NULL ,
the string "(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %d
.TP
.B %i
Print a signed decimal integer. The corresponding argument is taken as
an
.B int
and converted to its decimal representation. Negative values are printed
with a leading minus sign.

.TP
.B %%
Print a literal
.B %
character. No argument is consumed.

.PP
If a
.B %
character is followed by a character that is not one of the supported
conversion specifiers listed above, this implementation prints the
.B %
character followed by that unknown character, and both characters are
counted in the return value.

.PP
If
.I format
is
.BR NULL ,
or if a trailing
.B %
appears at the end of the string with no specifier following it,
.B _printf()
returns -1 and no output is produced.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the total number of characters written to the standard output
(excluding the terminating null byte used to end C strings).

.PP
On failure, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Print a simple sentence:
.PP
.nf
_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\\n");
.fi

.PP
Print a character and a percent sign:
.PP
.nf
_printf("Character: %c, percent: %%\\n", 'A');
.fi

.PP
Print integers:
.PP
.nf
_printf("d: %d, i: %i\\n", 1024, -98);
.fi
