.SH NAME
_printf \- produce output according to a format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
produces output according to a format string and a variable number of
arguments. It writes to the standard output (file descriptor 1).

The
.I format
string is composed of zero or more ordinary characters and conversion
specifiers. Ordinary characters are copied unchanged to the output.

A conversion specifier starts with the character '%', followed by one of
the supported specifier characters listed below.

The following conversion specifiers are supported:

.TP
.B %c
Print a single character.

.TP
.B %s
Print a NUL-terminated C string. If the corresponding argument is a null
pointer, the string "(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %%
Print a literal '%' character.

.TP
.B %d
Print a signed decimal integer.

.TP
.B %i
Print a signed decimal integer (equivalent to %d).

Unknown conversion specifiers cause the character '%' followed by the
unknown specifier character to be printed literally.

If
.I format
is a null pointer, or if a trailing '%' character occurs at the end of
the format string with no specifier following it,
.B _printf()
returns -1.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters printed (excluding the terminating null
byte used to end C strings).

On failure, a negative value is returned.
