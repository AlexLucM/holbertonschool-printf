.SH NAME
_printf \- produce output according to a format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
produces output according to a format string and a variable number of
arguments. It writes the result to the standard output (file descriptor 1)
using the system call
.BR write (2).

.PP
The
.I format
string is composed of zero or more ordinary characters and conversion
specifiers. Ordinary characters are printed as they appear in the string.

.PP
A conversion specifier starts with the character
.B %
followed by a single conversion character which specifies how the
corresponding argument is converted and printed.

.PP
The following conversion specifiers are supported:

.TP
.B %c
Print a single character. The argument is taken as an
.B int
but is converted to
.B char
before printing.

.TP
.B %s
Print a null-terminated C string. The argument must be of type
.B "char *" .
Characters are printed until a terminating null byte ('\0') is reached.
If the argument is
.BR NULL ,
the string "(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %d
.TP
.B %i
Print a signed decimal integer. The argument is taken as an
.B int
and converted to its decimal representation. Negative values are printed
with a leading minus sign.

.TP
.B %%
Print a literal
.B %
character. No argument is consumed.

.PP
If a
.B %
character is followed by a character that is not one of the supported
conversion specifiers above, this implementation prints the
.B %
character followed by that unknown character, and both characters are
counted in the return value.

.PP
If
.I format
is
.BR NULL ,
.B _printf()
returns -1 and no output is produced.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the total number of characters written to the standard output
(excluding the terminating null byte used to end C strings).

.PP
On failure, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Print a simple sentence:
.PP
.nf
_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
.fi

.PP
Print a character and a percent sign:
.PP
.nf
_printf("Character: %c, percent: %%\n", 'A');
.fi

.PP
Print integers:
.PP
.nf
_printf("d: %d, i: %i\n", 1024, -98);
.fi
